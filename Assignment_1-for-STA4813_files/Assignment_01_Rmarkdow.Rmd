#b.Fitting a simple linear regression model with Average_Purchase_Price as the response variable
#and Tractor_Power as the explanatory variable (Model 1).Also Interpreting the estimate slope coefficient
#Î²1.
# Fit a simple linear regression model
```{r}
Model_1 <- lm(Average_Purchase_Price ~ Tractor_Power, data = Machinery_T)
#summary(model_1)
summary(Model_1)
##need to interprete the slope

coef(summary(Model_1))
cat(" R squared= ",summary(Model_1)$r.squared, "\n",
    "Residual Standart Error= ",summary(Model_1)$sigma)

#Since the Intercept does not make sense, let subtract the mean from both the response variable and the independent variable
Machinery_T$Average_Purchase_Price<- Machinery_T$Average_Purchase_Price - mean(Machinery_T$Average_Purchase_Price)
Machinery_T$Tractor_Power<- Machinery_T$Tractor_Power- mean(Machinery_T$Tractor_Power)

#Are all assumptions of the linear regression of the met by the data?
# Obtain the fitted values and residuals
fitted_values <- fitted(Model_1)
residuals <- residuals(Model_1)
# Create the residual vs fitted values plot to assess the assumption of the constant varience of the residual
plot(fitted_values, residuals, xlab = "Fitted Values", ylab = "Residuals", main = "Residual vs Fitted Values Plot")

##Linearity assessment:
#since the residuals are randomly scattered around the horizontal line at zero, it suggests that the linear regression mode_1 captures the linear relationship between the predictors and the response variable reasonably well. This indicates that the assumption of linearity is met.

##Homoscedasticity assessment:
#In the residual vs fitted values plot, we see a random scatter of points with approximately equal spread above and below zero. This indicates that the variance of the residuals is consistent across the range of fitted values/ predictor variables.

# Obtain the standardized residuals for normality assumption assessment
std_resid <- rstandard(Model_1)
# Create the Normal Q-Q plot
qqnorm(std_resid, xlab = "Theoretical Quantiles", ylab = "Standardized Residuals", main = "Normal Q-Q Plot")
qqline(std_resid)  

##since there is deviation from the line this indicate departures from normality, such as skewness or heavy tails.

#d.checking How does logAverage_Purchase_Price change when Tractor_Power increases by 1?
```{r}
#relating to the fitted model on c, The logAverage_purchse_price chances by R0.07888 when tractor power increase by 1

```

#e.
```{r}
#As Tractor_Power increases by 1, the logAverage_Purchase_Price changes by
#  log(Y)i= 10.96500600 + 0.07888368(1)=8 11.04388968
# therefore, Avarage_purchase_price by R57815.14242
#which is the exp(10.96500600)
```
#f.Are linear least squares regression (LLSR) assumptions satisfied in Model 2? Why or why
#not?

# Obtain the fitted values and residuals
